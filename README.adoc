I would like to share an idea about RAII-like approach
for the resource management there.
I don't follow the Python world (my preference go for Scala, C++ or Rust),
so it's most likely the idea I present here is not new;
someone must have "discovered" it before me.
TL;DR The idea is to use coroutine trampolining to avoid nesting `with`
blocks in the code, and so to allow RAII approach:
when an instance goes out of its scope, a release action is executed.


## What do we mean by "resource management"?

By a _resource_ we mean anything which follows the pattern _Acquire_ -- _Use_ -- _Release_.
That is, a resource which is aquired should be eventually released.
A typical example from the native world is a block of memory allocated on the free store,
in {cpp} acquired with `new` and released with `delete` (C: `malloc`/`free`).

An example which everybody knows is opening a file (C: `fopen`) which returns
a _handle_ to a just opened file which we should later pass to some close mechanism
(C: `fclose`).
Some other examples most developers have met:
TCP sockets, database connections or mutexes.

The main problem with a proper resource managemnt is ensuring that once a resource is acquired,
it is released somewhere later, even in the presence of exceptions (in languages having them).
This is a well known problem, so I will make it short:

```python
def program():
    f = open('file.txt', 'w')
    ...
    f.write('Hello, world')
    ...
    f.close()
```

What if the code between `open` and `close` returns or throws
(in the Python lingo, raises)?
Then we leave the file open "forever", which is a resource _leak_.
For scripts which exit immediately, this might not be a big problem,
but for every long running application we need to ensure this will not happen:
If we open more and more files and don't close them,
the operation system will eventually reject opening one more;
if we don't close a mutex, we have a deadlock.

## Quick tour on resource management solutions

### RAII

An approach which C++ (and Rust and more) has taken is the
_Resource acquisition is initialization_ idiom --
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization[RAII].
The idea is that for each resource we introduce a scope-bound resource manager
(also known as _owner_).
The resource is usually acquired as part of instantiation of the manager
({cpp}: manager contructor, `mgr m(...)`),
and the release action is called automatically when the manager goes out of the scope
({cpp}: manager destructor, `m.~mgr()`).
For brevity I will not speak about the _move_ semantics which allows us to pass the ownership
(and hence the responsiblity to release the managed resource)
between different contexts. The file example in {cpp}:

```cpp
void program(const std::string & fname) {
    std::fstream f(fname);
    ...
    f << "Hello, world";
    ...
    // f.~fstream() is called here, right before }
}
```

The important thing is that the compiler ensures that the release action
is called _always_, on all exit paths, including the exceptional ones.
One nice property is that RAII approach nests really well:

```cpp
void program() {
    resource1 r1(...); // acquire the resoure #1    -------+
    resource2 r2(...); // acquire the resoure #2      --+  |
    ...                // use them                      |  |
    // automatically called (note the order):           |  |
    //   r2.~resource2() // release the resoure #2    --+  |
    //   r1.~resource1() // release the resoure #1  -------+
}
```

### Java, C#: Try-with-resources

This is the approach taken by many mainstream languages with automatic
memory management: Java, C#
(for the Python version of this, please refer to the next section).
The idea starts with `try`-`finally` block:

```java
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path));
try {
    ... // use `br` here
} finally {
    br.close();
}
```

(an example from https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html[Oracle Java tutorial]).
The runtime guarantees that whatever happens inside the `try` block,
the `finally` block will be executed.

The pattern is so common that the languages introduced some special measures.
In Java, it is the _try-with-resources_ block:

```java
try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path))) {
    return br.readLine();
}
```
We create an instance derived from a special interface `Closeable` (C#: `IDisposable`)
which defines the release action `close()` (C#: `dispose()`) called in case
of successful construction of `Closeable` instance.

This pattern can lead (and often leads) to a spaghetti code
(similar in nature to the _callback hell_ known from Javascript before `await`/`async` syntax)
with nested resources:

```java
try (Resource1 r1 = new Resource1()) {
    try (Resource1 r2 = new Resource2()) {
        try (Resource1 r3 = new Resource3()) {
            ...
        }
    }
}
```
There are ways to deal with this nesting and the code shifted "too much right",
but it's not the purpose of this text to discuss them.

### Python: `with` statement

The Python approach is similar, but more functional-programming like
(quite surprisingly in Python) --
we will use this fact to our advantage later.
The correct way to open a file for writing in Python is the following:

```python
def program():
    with open('file.txt', 'w') as f:
        ...
        f.write('Hello, world')
        ...
```

The `with` statement starts a block of code, introducing a new variable (`as ...`)
for a handle (`f`) for the just acquired resource (opened file).
What happens underneath here:

1. `open(...)` creates an instance of a _context manager_ (call it `ctx`)
   which saves the parameters, but itself does nothing,
   just represents what it means to acquire and release the resource.
   (This is the functional programming face of it:
   to _defer_ doing the actual side effect to somewhere else.)
2. Then, `ctx.\\__init__()` is called, making the system call to open the file with parameters
   saved from the `ctx` initialization.
3. When leaving the block of code indented after `with`, Python calls `ctx.\\__exit__()`
   which closes the file.
   The `\\__exit__` method is called both on standard return and if an exception is raised.

As with try-with-resources in Java or C#, we often see Python codebases nesting
`with` blocks and code there shifted too much right:

```python
def program():
    with resource1(...) as r1:
        with resource2(...) as r2:
            with resource3(...) as r3:
                ...
```

Again, there are ways to deal with this, but it requires some care
which is not always seen in real codebases.

### Other approaches -- find them yourself!

This text is not meant as an exhaustive resource on resource management --
there are definitely other approaches,
the most interesting I know is a `Resource[IO, T]` abstraction in the IO monad world.
See the https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/docs/std/resource[Cats Effect] implementation of it.


## RAII in Python

As mentioned above, there is a problem that nesting `with` blocks causes our code
to look like spaghetti shifted too much right.
I would like to present an idea how this can be prevented
using another Python language feature, _coroutines_.
I have not seen this before, but I'm not a Python developer (meh)
and so it's very likely somebody got the idea before me --
yet I was not able to find any reference on Google for this
(maybe I searched for bad words).
I would like to know any prior knowledge on this:
please let me know at marekscholle@gmail.com.

The idea is to have something like RAII in Python -- when a variable
goes out of the scope, we want a release action to run:

```python
def program():
    r1 = <RAII> resource1()
    r2 = <RAII> resource2()
    r3 = <RAII> resource3()
    ...
    # on program exit, run the release actions
    # for `r1`, `r2`, `r3`, in reversed order, similarly to RAII in C++
```
The `<RAII>` stands for some "magic" to convince Python to "register" release actions
to be run when we leave the scope.
This looks like as an impossible task in Python, but it is not.
What we want to do in the _runtime_ is what Python allows us to do with
the `with` statement at the time of writing the code:

```python
def program():
    with resource1(...) as r1:
        with resource2(...) as r2:
            with resource3(...) as r3:
              ...
```

i.e. we want to delegate the guarantee to call release actions to Python itself
and not "invent" some new "runtime" on top of Python runtime
(which is what IO libraries do in JVM).
At the same time, we want to avoid using `with` blocks and their inherent nesting
(which probably is by design and in accordance with the rule
_Explicit is better than implicit_).

The idea is to not call `program` directly,
but manage its execution as a coroutine execution:

```python
def program():
    r1 = yield resource1(...)
    r2 = yield resource2(...)
    r3 = yield resource3(...)
    ...

# for the implementation of the "driver" of this coroutine
# please continue reading
```

An oversimplified introduction:
a coroutine is a "function" from which you can return back to the caller
with `yield` (instead of `return`), but unlike with ordinary functions,
the caller can pass the execution _back to the callee_
to the point where it was leaved before (after the last `yield`),
possibly passing a value there -- all you need is to assign a result of `yield` to a variable.

So, a coroutine execution can be driven from outside.
In the example above, the code driving the `program` needs to execute it
_as if_ it was an ordinary function

```python
def program():
    with resource1(...) as r1:
        with resource2(...) as r2:
            with resource3(...) as r3:
                ...
```

Without further ado, here it is:

```python
def program():
    r1 = yield resource1(...)
    r2 = yield resource2(...)
    r3 = yield resource3(...)
    ...

def run(program):
    coro = program()
    def stack(res):
        with res as r:
            next_res = coro.send(r)
            stack(next_res)
    stack(next(coro))

run(program)
```

What happens here?

* The `run` function creates a _generator_ from the supplied `program`.
  We save this generator as `coro`.
  Note that `coro` is now _suspended_, i.e. prepared to be run;
  nothing has happened yet.
* Next, `next(coro)` is called.
  This actually enters the body of `program`
  and executes `resource1(...)` which returns a _context manager_ `res1` for the resource #1
  (not the resource handle itself as mentioned above -- this is the crucial point).
* The context manager `res1` is _yielded_ ("sent" in the sense of message passing)
  from `program` back to `run`, and passed there to `stack` as `res`.
* Now we are at the line with the `with` statement which calls `r = res1.\\__enter__()`.
  The `r` is the handle to to the just acquired resource #1.
* `coro.send(r)` resumes the `program` where it was left and sends there the handle `r`
  which is saved as local variable `r1`.
* Now, the `program` continues and creates a context manager `res2` for the resource #2
  which is again yielded (sent) to `run` and saved to `next_res` variable.
* `run` continues by executing `stack(next_res)` and the history repeats:
  we acquire the resource #2 by ``res2.\\__enter__()``ing it,
  the `program` is resumed again provided the resource handle
  which is there saved to a local variable `r2`
* And so on.

So, we gradually build the nested `with` blocks inside the `run` driver
and each time we make a new `with` block, we resume the `program`
with the resource handle --
and since the nesting is done inside `run`
(with the help of recursion instead of hardcoding it),
the `program` itself is relieved from it.

Let me show you a concrete example:

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def resource(r):
    print('resource::acquire', r)
    try:
        yield r
    finally:
        print('resource::release', r)

def program():
    a = yield resource(1)
    print('use a =', a)

    b = yield resource(2)
    print('use b =', b)

    c = yield resource(3)
    print('use c =', c)

    assert False, "intentional error"

def run(program):
    coro = program()
    def stack(r):
        with res as r:
            next_res = coro.send(r)
            stack(next_res)
    stack(next(coro))

run(program)
```
The output:
```
resource::acquire 1
use a = 1
resource::acquire 2
use b = 2
resource::acquire 3
use c = 3
resource::release 3
resource::release 2
resource::release 1
```
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
    assert False, "intentional error`
```

The `@contextmanager` part is just a convenient way to create a context manager.
You can see that the `program` itself is a nice function
(more precisely, a generator function)
without any syntactic noise
and without any nesting, yet even in the presence of exception (`assert False`),
the release actions are called for `r3`, `r2` and `r1`
(in the right, reversed order).

Again: This idea I have not seen anywhere, but this does not mean I am the first person
who "discovered" it.
Please let me know if you have seen this before.

This is the idea itself and what follows is just an iteration / warning that there are caveats.
If we change our `program` to

```python
def program():
    for i in range(1000):
        a = yield resource(i)
        print('use a =', a)

    assert False, "intentional error"
```

and `run` it, we get an unpleseant
`RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object`
caused by recursive calling of `stack`.

I'm not a Python person, so I will present a simple solution for this,
but I wouldn't be surprised if this had a better solution --
I just want to demonstrate a solution exists:

```python
async def run(program):
    coro = program()

    async def stack(res):
        with res as x:
            next_res = coro.send(x)
            next_stack = asyncio.create_task(stack(next_res))
            await next_stack

    await stack(next(coro))

asyncio.run(run(program))
```
Instead of letting the execution stack grow,
we use `asyncio` to turn `stack` into an "awaitable" `Task`
we we submit to the underlying executor.
This way, every call of `stack` gets its own indepedent context
and no `RecursionError` will happen.

Let us try again with this `asyncio` version of `run`.
The output of `program` is then
```
resource::acquire 0
use 0
resource::acquire 1
use 1
...
resource::acquire 998
use 998
resource::acquire 999
use 999
resource::release 999
resource::release 998
...
resource::release 1
resource::release 0
```
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
    assert False, "intentional error"
AssertionError: intentional error
```

---

Please let me know if you find this intersting
or if you have seen this trick before, making the `with` statement nesting
inside  a function driving a coroutine execution.
To my best knowledge, this is not published anywhere as of today,
but I don't follow Python world and googling is often not much helpful
in getting this kind of information.

I can imagine that for the use case which made me think about
the ways of resource management in Python and which requires
acquiring many nested resources, this can be a revolution
in code safety / clarity.

Waiting for your feedback 🙏
